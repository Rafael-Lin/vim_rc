(1)他們家是我喜歡的深度110cm那種(不是一般90~103)，以及因為110cm深度，大腿支撐完整。甚至可以盤腿在沙發上。
(2)坐點在45cm處，是最理想的高度，搭配椅面深，腿部很放鬆。
(3)扶手寬度15~20cm都有，屬於肥大的扶手，我坐點45cm，扶手不算太高，剛好可以當頭枕躺著。
(4)椅背和椅面角度剛剛好，對於男女都可以坐得很服貼，腰部不會簍空。
(5)角架高度有符合我需求15cm高，Dyson掃地機器人可自由進出。
(6)不會太軟，也不會太硬到感覺把你整個人往外挺，包覆感好。

滑門 : 
   1. 鐵拉門
   雙軌的四片拉門，黑鋁框+5mm強化清玻璃+上懸吊加下軌+少連動加緩衝的價格是快五萬，寬度322cm、高度255cm，其中加緩衝的價格就大概加了快1萬...不過少了與牆碰撞的傷害，才不會等到哪天牆受傷或是玻璃可能有意外破掉的危險（強化玻璃應該不會這麼容易破？）
而下軌的配合施工沒有另外加錢，我用的Krono Saxon地板原本連工帶料的錢就可以幫忙處理。

* meeting with bram
** Q1 : introduce yourself
*** two years in Linkou, the functional cluster mainly source and motion control
I joined ASML in 2018, and was responsible for yieldStar SW. I was in Linkou and
join PTS sensor team in the beginning. Then the work content is changed because
my role mainly to support Linkou factory, so I mainly work with VHV D&E SW team
on source and motion control functional cluster. I went to VHV for three times
to support YS380 NPI product. The colleagues there is very friendly and whenever
I have any questions, they are willing to help to out.

At that time, although David is my GL, but I joined the activities with other SW
D&E mostly for daily scrum.
 
*** the difference between HMI and ASML SW is that the code is more organized
    for ASML. I think that's because there are more SW FTEs for yieldstar. In
    HMI, the schedule is very tight, and there are too many requests from
    fields. That's part of the reason why the structure of the SW is not so good.
    
1. a little bit messy
2. didn't used auto-fac and some design pattern
3. challenge : integrate the concept of ASML SW into HMI would take some time,
4. challenge : integrate the code of SBI and MBI is a long way to go. 
5. hard to ensure quality due to the machine time is hard to get
6. unit test is what we can do in current phase
7. I'm a little bit junior, although I can solve jira tickets, but don't have the overview of the whole SW structure
8. 

responsibility of FCA
1. regular meeting with other FCAs for new product
2. code review on each pull request to find out potential risk and ensure quality
3. make sure each changes are fully documented
4. help team members to overcome technical difficulties.
5. 

what cultures do you like in ASML:
1. speak up
2. be transparent
3. v-model
4. love to invest on people's development, for example, all employee can join the course of English or 7 habits of highly effectively people if necessary
5. Way of working


*** how to ensure quality
in ASML, the good part of it is the concept of V-model. That means before any SW
changes, the EDS must contain the new design for new product, and after the SW
implementation is done, the functional testing is necessary to ensure the
quality of the modified functions and TAR have to be written down and recorded
In the end, SW FTE have to talk to GL/TL about what change he made, and make
sure the all relevant documents are updated.

** QN : any quetstions?
*** I know Tom is the architect for Infra team previously, so now if I take the role, what's the responsibility?
*** not familiar with the Role and responsibility of this FCA
